# Hello-World
I'm a newbie to coding but with your help and that of a very talented friend coder hopefully I can begin to learn myself. My first project was to install my Raspberry Pi onto my network. Following Armzilla's guide to emulating a Phillips Hue to voice control my Mi Casa Vera home automation. I have the on/off URls created but now want to learn how to dim my dimmable lights.
